## { Default CRA Readme }

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

#### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br>
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br>
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

#### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br>
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

#### `yarn build`

Builds app locally; allows your machine to build the prod version of the app-- you can find these files in the ./build/ directory alongside this readme.

#### `aws s3 sync build/ s3://stardewdex`

Copies production files to AWS (updates the hosting/serving in S3 & CloudFront). This step will fail on your machine. :smile_cat:
